CAREFUL!

the project files listed in here may use relative paths with the root directory of the git project as refernce! I.e. if you wish to use them, copy them there!

also: on my linux machine, I need to use QT4 in order to create the makefile from the TOS.pro file:
qmake-qt4 TOS.pro

GENERAL WARNING: Do NOT use the Makefile provided in this directory, create your own instead! Only given as a reference!
